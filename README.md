Welcome to The SOOMLA Project
---
The SOOMLA Project is a series of open-source projects that aims to help game developers get better in-app purchasing stores for their games. The open-source platform-specific projects include everything a game developer needs, from storage of virtual items to purchasing mechanisms with the various devices' native stores. As part of our open-source projects you also get the store's layout which you can customize with your own game's assets.

SOOMLA-Android-Store

The Android store is a Java project that works seamlessly with Google Play's in-app purchasing API. SOOMLA-Android-Store is tightly coupled with Soomla-Storefront to provide you with the store's UI. All you need to do is let it know your specific game's assets and you're good to go.
